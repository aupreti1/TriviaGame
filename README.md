# TriviaGame
I created a game with trivial questions based on sharks.

At the top of the page is a play option to play the song associated with the game.
Click the start button to begin the game.
There are 17 questions and you have 10 sec to answer each question.
You will be given multiple options for each question.
If you click the correct answer, Correct! will pop up.
If you click the incorrect choice, it will say Incorrect! and will show the correct answer.
If time runs out, it will pop up Time is Up! and show the correct answer.
At the end, the number of how many correct, inncorrect, and incomplete will show.
There will be a button that says try again, to retry the game. 

I made the questions and answers inside an array. From there I created a function with a for loop to 
sort through the array and display the questions and answers. Once the user clicks on the answer (done with an on click function) a page will display if their choice was correct or not and the correct answer. There is a count down function to count down the timer from 10. The number of questions and which one you are on is also displyed.
